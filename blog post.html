			<p> The Texas Rugby Union (TRU) introduced a women’s DII club league this season and saw six teams from Texas and Oklahoma compete. It provided meaningful competition to teams that are still building toward the DI Red River conference’s level of play, while also giving larger clubs, like Austin, an option for its second side. It’s been a fruitful year for the Valkyries, which not only repeated as DI Red River champions but also saw its first DII team win the first TRU title.

			The Texas Rugby Union (TRU) introduced a women’s DII club league this season and saw six teams from Texas and Oklahoma compete. It provided meaningful competition to teams that are still building toward the DI Red River conference’s level of play, while also giving larger clubs, like Austin, an option for its second side. It’s been a fruitful year for the Valkyries, which not only repeated as DI Red River champions but also saw its first DII team win the first TRU title.
			 

			 
			“If you want to keep players around it’s important to give them game time,” Austin president Francine Bray spoke to the challenges of carrying numbers. “[In the past,] we scheduled friendlies against DII teams and colleges, but it was a struggle to keep players around because we couldn’t get them minutes.”
			 
			When the TRU announced the inception of a DII league, Austin upped its recruitment to ensure that it could support a full second team. The DII league with its full schedule and local travel made retaining players easier. There was a reason to come to practice, learn the structure, grow and push the first side.
			 
			“A lot of that credit goes to the TRU admins who are constantly looking to grow women’s rugby,” Bray said of the DII league’s creation. “The cities in Texas are large. We should be fielding lots of teams, at least in the eastern part of the state. Cities as large as Houston and Dallas could have three teams easily. There are always the field and coaching and financial issues, but the player base should be there.”<p>
