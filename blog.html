				<p>Alex Goode has the perfect opportunity to prove to Eddie Jones that size does not matter on Sunday as he prepares to line up for the Barbarians at Twickenham, meaning he will have played for and against England in the same season. He has admitted he will have to sing the national anthem in his head.

				Goode concedes that “it’ll be weird playing against the white shirts” having fallen out of favour with Jones since his last England appearance in November to the extent that he was not even named in the squad to tour Argentina despite the absence of 15 British & Irish Lions.

				His continued snub is head-scratching to say the least considering his form for Saracens – he scored the decisive try in the Champions Cup final against Clermont to cap a magnificent display, forcing Jones to explain his omission by saying: “Sometimes you can be a great player in a great side but not necessarily a great Test player.”

				Jones has also recently claimed that “I’m convinced we need some more size in the backs” which may explain the absence of Goode and the presence of uncapped wingers Joe Cokanasiga and Nathan Earle on the plane to Argentina.

				“There will always be a place for a ball-playing rugby player. My footwork, my ability to tackle and make breaks is still there,” said Goode. “That is a valuable asset. Wingers, since I have been playing, have only got bigger and faster and stronger. That has always been the case but I think the best back lines in the world always have a good combination of physicality, speed and good understanding. You need that I think.</p>

			<p>According to Oxford Dictionaries Online, the exercise was named in the 1930s for American physiologist Royal H. Burpee, who developed the burpee test. He earned a PhD in applied physiology from Columbia University in 1940 and created the "burpee" exercise as part of his PhD thesis as a quick and simple way to assess fitness.[2] The exercise was popularized when the United States Armed Services adopted it as a way to assess the fitness level of recruits when the US entered World War II. Consisting of a series of the exercises performed in rapid succession, the test was meant to be a quick measure of agility, coordination and strength.t is unfortunate that many "self-appointed" fitness gurus deceive the public with expensive, ineffective gadgets and gimmicks. A quick browse of the Internet will lead you to many sites offering "miracle" solutions to fat loss and fitness.

			Unfortunately, this nonsense is not confined to the Internet. Each month we can browse the magazine rack at our local bookstore and find a dozen or more fitness magazines all claiming to contain the secret to strength and six-pack abs.

			These magazines are loaded with repackaged routines and exercises. Their authors are often guilty of overcomplicating the training process.

			By overcomplicating the process, gurus gain control over the public. Many athletes are left lost and confused when scouring through each month's new "training breakthrough". It gets expensive trying to keep up with each magazine and training gadget.</p>
