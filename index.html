		 	Rugby Ninja was born in 2012 by founder Ashley "Shalay" Mefford.  Shalay has been playing rugby for 15 years and is very passionate about the sport. We pride ourselves in a good quality product that players and fans will want to wear at all times.  All our shirts are on a soft Next Level Apparel or a comparable quality brand.  We are always looking to expand and offer new shirt designs.  If you have any shirts you want to see, please contact us.  Who knows, if we love the idea, maybe we will make it. • Will I get hurt? Rugby is fairly misunderstood in the United States, and the injury factor is one area of confusion. Yes, players get hurt playing rugby, in games and in practice. But all sports have a risk factor and rugby is very much in the normal curve. We do get different injuries than some sports, like broken noses or black eyes, but we don’t get the serious knee injuries or broken bones any more frequently than your local soccer or basketball league. WE TAKE SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY, especially for our necks and heads. When we teach tackling, rucking and scrumming, we are always careful to teach proper technique to protect these areas. After all, we don’t get to wear helmets or pads right? So everyone’s safety depends on everyone knowing the proper technique. In addition, personal liability health care is required to play on any rugby team in the US. We play a 9-month season broken into two parts: spring season begins in mid-January (when we’re glad we live in Texas) with games and training through May. We resume practice in mid-August or early September (when that Texas perk has faded a bit) and play, hopefully, through the National Championships in November. We are off for the winter holiday time.

						<p>A 46-point win in the 2016 Women's Division II National Championship match prompted a move to Division I for Life West. Amazingly enough, the Gladiatrix have looked just as dominant in their run to the D1 title game.
						In Arizona, former AIG Women's Collegiate All-Americans Bitsy Cairns and Amy Naber scored a pair of first-half tries to help build a 43-5 halftime lead against the Austin Valkyries before eventually dusting off Texas' best, 85-5, in the Quarterfinals.

						Life West's Semifinal opponent looked just as sharp on Day 1 of National Playoffs. The Utah Vipers nearly matched the Gladiarix's 85-point outburst by putting 81 points on the Tempe Ninjas during a 64-point Quarterfinal win. The Vipers, however, were not able to match their success in the Semifinals versus Life West.Should I work out in a particular way to get ready or stay healthy?
						Yes. There are two important things to train for when you play rugby: speed endurance & power/strength. Speed endurance means that while you need a good endurance base (running 2 miles at a medium jog shouldn’t ruin you), you REALLY need to be able to make short to medium length sprints over and over. So once you get that decent base, start doing interval running (jog, sprint for 30 seconds, jog to recover, sprint, etc), run hills or stairs (walk back down), or anything else where you change speed and recover while still moving. You can do intervals on treadmills, around your city block, or at a track. Power & strength means beach muscles are good (biceps that pop) but core, butt & leg strength is really more important. If you are already familiar with weightlifting, try to include squats, leg press, cleans and lots of shoulder/back work into your routine. If you’ve never lifted before, that’s fine too – just ask your coach or captains for some advice first. You’ll never know how strong you can be until you play rugby.  In addition to dues, we are constantly fundraising so that when the team travels the club can afford to pay for rental cars and hotels. Players are almost always responsible for purchasing their own plane tickets, but on good years we are sometimes able to offer stipends to players for travel. Our club Treasurer collects money and can work out payment plans with any player – we have a policy that you must pay at least some of your club dues before playing your first game, but we are also flexible and can work out a system that will work for your budget.

						What are the rules to rugby anyways?
						Ah, good question. We will provide you a copy of a well-known “rookie primer” about the basic rules. You can also find this helpful & humorous document at http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~radrugby/rookie_primer.html. There are usually a few decent books on rugby rules in local bookshops, but you really have to just learn as you go – and don’t worry, it takes a little while to get it all sorted out so be patient with yourself. Lots of veterans will admit to not knowing all the rules every second of every game.</p>
